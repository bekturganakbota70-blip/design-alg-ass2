Selection Sort implementation and benchmark were developed collaboratively with Araizhan Tazhimova.
Analysis Report on Partner's Algorithm Implementation

The code follows a clear object-oriented structure and adheres to the repository guidelines. 
All main functionalities are properly separated into packages: algorithms, metrics, and cli. 
The implementation includes performance tracking through a PerformanceTracker class and uses 
a BenchmarkRunner for measuring execution time and efficiency.

Correctness:
The algorithm produces accurate results for various input types including empty arrays, 
single-element arrays, sorted and reverse-sorted data. Unit tests are well structured and 
cover edge cases.

Performance:
Based on benchmark results, the algorithm shows expected performance behavior. 
For small inputs, the execution is very fast, but for larger sizes, 
execution time increases according to the theoretical time complexity of O(n^2) for comparison-based sorting algorithms.
The implementation could benefit from additional optimizations, 
such as reducing unnecessary swaps or implementing hybrid approaches for large datasets.

Overall:
The partnerâ€™s implementation is correct, well-documented, and easy to understand. 
The code is clean and logically organized, making it easy to test and integrate with the benchmark and CSV exporter.
