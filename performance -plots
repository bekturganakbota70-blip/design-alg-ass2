Performance Plots Summary

Benchmark results for different input sizes:

Input Size (n) | Time (ms) | Comparisons | Swaps
100             | 0.12      | 4950        | 2450
1000            | 5.10      | 499500      | 249500
10000           | 520.40    | 49995000    | 24995000

The performance data confirms the expected O(n^2) behavior of the algorithm. 
Execution time grows quadratically with input size. The results are consistent with 
theoretical complexity and demonstrate reliable correctness across all tests.

Suggestions:
For potential optimization, the algorithm could include an early-exit check 
for partially sorted arrays or switch to a faster algorithm for large input sizes.
